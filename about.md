She belongs to a group of young polish musicians who moved to Scandinavia in search for openness, freedom of style and fresh means in music.

From her early age she was associated with Culture Center in her family town, being surrounded by artists, musicians and actors, and ever since, all of her life experiences were circulating around this root.

Her psychology studies also took interest in music, mostly in human reactions to certain features of music pieces. In 2010 she completed her research focused on life quality among polish jazz musicians, and defended her master thesis in social psychology titled: <I>"Jazz-my life. Experience in musician’s role and its influence on self-structure and cognitive-emotional adaptation."</I> Couple of weeks after her defense she began studies at Carl Nielsen Academy of Music in Denmark, where she currently lives.</p>
