<p> More facts:</p>

  <li>Ania performed on stage for the first time when she was only 4 years old. Since then, music and art have been her inseparable companions. Through 20 years of music education she received training in composition, arrangement, music theory, jazz, folk and classical music, piano, opera singing, performance and artistic leadership. From early age she was a member of children musical group, folk dance group, choirs, youth brass orchestra and many smaller formations allowing her to explore the secrets of performance.

 <li>She has two master degrees: in Music Performance from Rhythmic Music Conservatory in Copenhagen (2016), and in psychology from University of Social Sciences and Humanities in Warsaw (2010). Her master thesis in psychology focuses on life-quality among polish jazz musicians and is titled: <i>"Jazz-my life. Experience in musician’s role and its influence on self-structure and cognitive-emotional adaptation."</i> She works both as an artist and as a therapist, and you can read about her clinical practice here: www.annarybacka.dk

 <li>Working with different genres, exploring folk music from all over the world, and having a playful approach to the voice allows Ania to freely operate with different vocal techniques. Within the same day, she can sing Vivaldi with orchestra in church, participate in Bulgarian choir rehearsal using white voice, and play a swing concerts at a jazz club. She’s always dreamt of a music world without labels and genres, rules and limitations, where one can truly express herself in her full complexity.
