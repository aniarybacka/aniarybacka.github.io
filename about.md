<p align="justify">Ania Rybacka is a polish music artist living in Denmark. She belongs to a group of young musicians who moved to Scandinavia in search for openness, freedom of style and means in expression through art-form. Relatively early she started cooperation with Culture Center in her family town, performing on stage for the first time when she was only 4 years old. Since then music has been her inseparable companion. She was a member of children musical group, folk dance class, singing class, choir, youth brass orchestra and many smaller formations. She received an education in composition, jazz music, piano playing, classical singing, performance and artistic leadership. She always studied music simultaneously with general education, and many other activities. In 2010 she graduated both from University of Social Sciences and Humanities and Warsaw Jazz College ‘Bednarska’. Her psychology studies also took interest in music, mostly in human reactions to certain music features. Her master thesis focuses on life-quality among polish jazz musicians and is titled: <i>"Jazz-my life. Experience in musician’s role and its influence on self-structure and cognitive-emotional adaptation."</i> Just after graduation, she moved to Denmark and began new music studies. At the moment she is about to complete second masters in Music Performance at Rhythmic Music Conservatory.
