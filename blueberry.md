<big>Blueberry</big> is an electronic-acustic project born in Denmark, initiated by Ania Rybacka & Adi Zukanović, joined last year by Roux Spana.

Coming form different cultural backgrounds and experiences in a wide range of music styles, three musicians gather their forces in an intimate act, creating sounds that seem to sigh and hypnothize. Electronized music produced with synthesizers, and computers in the back, gives the impression of opening surrounding space, still remaining organic and subtle. With this accompaniment, feminin voice tells us stories about human weaknesses – desire, submissivenes, irrational needs and imperfection.

**Ania Rybacka** - vocals, looper, shakers, effects<br>
**Adi Zukanovic** - synthesizer, effects, piano<br>
**Roux Spana** - beats, effects, keyboards<br>
