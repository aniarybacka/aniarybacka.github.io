<p align="justify">Project <big><b>Sphere</b></big> was born from pursuit of inspiration and broadly defined beauty. Three highly regarded musicians of New Sceen - Ania Rybacka (voc), Marek Kadziela (git) and Kuba Dybzynski (cl) - make music that creates an intimate sphere, inviting listeners to play an active role in this aesthetic and emotional experience. Compositions of Sphere members are a combination of jazz and contemporary music with their favorite features of classical, and folk tradition.  At the moment they are working on their album, and performing in Denmark and Poland. <br><br>
