><I><small>A sphere (from Greek σφαῖρα — sphaira)- is a perfectly round geometrical and circular object in three-dimensional space that resembles the shape of a completely round ball. Like a circle, which, in geometrical contexts, is in two dimensions, a sphere is the set of points that are all the same distance from a given point in space. /Wikipedia/</small></I>

<p align="justify">Like in description above, project <big><b>Sphere</b></big> is a set of elements creating a perfectly round musical space. Those elements take form of three musicians filling the distance between them with full living sound, combining favorite features of classical, jazz and folk tradition. Their role is equal - a movement of one always causes maneuver of others, creating one body, always striving for inspiration and broadly defined beauty.<br><br>
