Welcome to my new webpage! I wanted it to be simple and eye-friendly, and I'm pretty happy with the result,
but users suggestions are always very welcome - please contact me if you have any, concerning this website.


Two big tours are coming up for Blueberry and Sphere. I will get better at updating concert dates I promise!
Right now you can read about these bands and listen to the music, by klicking on menu "projects"


More and more matter is going to show up here, so don't hesite to visit this website from time to time.

Lots of good vibes!
