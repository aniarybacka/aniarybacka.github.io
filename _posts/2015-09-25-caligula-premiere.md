I have had a privilege to be a part of the team creating a modern theater play based on Albert Camus work - Caligula. In cooperation with sound designer and musician Asger Kudahl we have chosen to build Caligulas music universe using modern electronic sound blended with organic vocals of actors playing on the stage. The outcome of our work you can experience at the premiere, the 25th of september in the Danish Roal Theater, Skuespilhuset, Lille Sal.<br>
Caligula will be pefromed monday to saturday until 17th of october.
