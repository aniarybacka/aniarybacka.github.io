It has come to my realisation, that many teachers and music instructors believe that their professional role is simply - to teach music. To share their wisdom and experience in music their field, and show practice techniques that they believe work for certain instrument. Maybe also to inspire students with interesting music literature. Transferring collected knowledge to young minds eager to discover the world of music and master instrument skills… Only if it was that simple and direct. How many of you had troubles with students not showing up, not listening, giving up, not improving, having troubles with concentration?

In my practice as a vocal coach and music teacher, the most challenging and necessary has been to provide my listeners with what they actually, individually need. Only this way I can give them something, make a change in their lives through music. If making music is considered a goal, then there are many elements absolutely necessary to reach it, but often - not present. For some students it might be self-efficacy - belief that they can achieve goals on their own, do great music, create something valuable, and sometimes simply - improve their condition. For others it is passion and motivation - feeling that the spark appearing from time to time in their guts has a power to turn into flames driving their life, enthusiasm, and accompanying their everyday’s journey. Some people who want to learn singing, don’t even feel worthy presenting themselves to others. They are afraid of hearing their own voice - cause it might not be good enough.. Many of them compare themselves too much to to others, believing that the grass is greener on the other side of the river. Some cover their performance, showing all the cards they have already in first two minutes on the stage, cause they are afraid that their nakedness is boring and imperfect.

I believe that in order to really meet our listeners we need to consider, that music and art are just instruments in the search of happiness and meaningful life. Kids want to play music mostly because they want to be good at something, be special in their group, and be able to express them selves (“Effortless Mastery” by Kenny Werner, 1996). Singers who sign up for choirs often want to be be a part of a special community where they can spend quality time with others; a part of something bigger, greater, a harmonious group which has got their back and has a common dream. 

Even though our times are  bombarded with mindfulness-course offers, live-your-dream mottos, motivation speeches on TED, role-models available everywhere there is still a great deal of society not believing in themselves, not feeling worthy or talented enough, not being able to concentrate and find internal motivation. Age surprisingly does not make a difference - in my practice I meet as many insecure adults as insecure teenagers. Power of self-esteem and self-efficacy in learning is still underrated. Great musicians and artist are made of those, who accept themselves for who they are. Who are not afraid of being criticised, making a failure or not satisfying others. They learn fast and think constructive. And our role as teachers is to help them accept themselves and through teaching music - show them that they CAN make great things. Adjust our exercises, intensity and lesson schedule to their individual needs - personal or as a particular group, no matter how complex it is - we are responsible for getting to know it. 

I can’t emphasise how important it is for learning, listening, and in the end - for quality of ART created. I also believe, that this is the way, talent is developing - form courage to experiment, express, communicate and be ourselves. Just think, that we could actually affect people’s lives like this, changing the world from where we are standing, and this way contributing to art. Luckily passion is a contagious disease…
