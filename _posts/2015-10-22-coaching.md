Through recent conversations with my colleagues and students I have realised that many teachers underestimate the social impact they have on their pupils, and neglect pedagogical aspects of teaching. For instance, many music teachers believe that their only responsibility is simply - to instruct in music. To share their wisdom and experience in music field, and show practice techniques that they believe work for certain instrument. To show some interesting music literature, transferring collected knowledge to young minds eager to discover the world of music and master instrument skills - only if it was that direct as copying data from one computer to another. The way of communicating with young people can greatly change their interest in the subject, motivation to work, self-respect, passion, courage to try new, how much they believe in themselves. All that and more, no matter really, what the subject is. It can also discourage, frustrate, stress and decrease self-confidence. Being the authority in musical aspect of our student’s life we are also a source of social and individual information linked to situation of playing music. While teaching we are partly the audience, the narrator and interpreter for our pupils.
<br><br>
In my practice as a vocal coach and music teacher, the most effective in enhancing learning experience has been to diagnose what my listeners actually, individually need and provide them with suited, personal tools in one-to-one sessions. My mission is to make a positive impact on other people’s live and I believe, that I have a chance to do so only by efficient communication, reflection and understanding. If for example performing music is a goal, then there are many non-musical elements to consider in teaching. For example self-efficacy - student's belief that they can achieve goals on their own, do great music, create something valuable, and sometimes simply - improve their condition. Passion and motivation, belief that the things we do are meaningful, and that nurturing our interests can lead to exciting, and passionate life. Some people who want to learn singing, don’t even feel worthy presenting themselves to others. They are afraid of hearing their own voice - cause it might not be good enough. Many compare themselves too much to to others, believing that the grass is greener on the other side of the river. Some cover their performance, showing all the cards they have already in first two minutes on the stage, cause their nakedness might turn out to be boring and imperfect. It all comes from narratives what we can influence and liberate - the way we evaluate performance, interpret audience’s role, mistakes, how we understand success has an impact on the way our student thinks about performance and him/herself under performance. 
<br><br>
I believe that in order to really meet the person we teach we should actually consider, that music and art are just instruments in the search of happiness and meaningful life. Just like making good deeds, creating a valuable art can make us feel good about who we are and bring meaning to our stories. Sometimes singing in the class once a week for an experienced singer and performer is enough. Singers who sign up for choirs often want to be be a part of a special community where they can spend quality time with others; a part of something bigger, greater, a harmonious group has a common dream, a spiritual lift. Kids want to play music mostly because they want to be good at something, be special in their group (“Effortless Mastery” by Kenny Werner, 1996). Some music adepts will strive for popularity. Others priority is to free themselves from technical and formal limits, playing their instrument. Some want to make new trends in art and make impact on the future. Some want all those things together. Not every music student wants to be a champion and it also should be ok. Understanding what it is exactly that brings students to a music teacher gives us a chance to become better at what we - instructors - do. And through really meeting our listeners we can inspire them to have bigger dreams, and believe they can do great things if they want to. 
<br><br>
I can’t emphasize enough how important this all is for learning, listening, and in the end - for quality of ART created. I also believe, that this is the way, talent is developing - form courage to experiment, express, communicate and be ourselves. Just think, that we could actually affect people’s lives like this, changing the world from where we are standing, and this way contributing to art. Luckily passion is a contagious disease…
