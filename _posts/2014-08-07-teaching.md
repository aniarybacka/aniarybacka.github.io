Sommer holidays inevitably come to an end, and the new academic season begins. I'm opening my doors for new students, who would like to improve their singing, performing skills and vocal technique.<br>

I'm a singer, vocal coach and composer, currently doing masters in music performance in Rytmisk Musikkonservatorium in Copenhagen. For last couple of years I've had a chance to perform around Europe in different projects, and I was awarded on vocal competitions in Finland (Lady Summetime, 2009), Poland (Voicingers, 2009), and Germany (2008), among others. In teaching I approach every student individually, which means I prepare exercises and teaching methods specifically for their needs. I enjoy the time with my students a lot, and involve in developing their opportunities.
I work as a teacher in couple of places, please contact me for more info.<br><br>
