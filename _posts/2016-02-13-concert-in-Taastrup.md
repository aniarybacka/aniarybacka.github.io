Ann Fisher - Tribute to Jazz Divas<br><br>

Ann Fisher (Ania Rybacka) is a singer and improviser awarded on international vocal competitions in Finland, Poland, Germany and Turkey for story telling and creativity. For almost 5 years she’s been living in Denmark and performing with her own music as well as singing for Danish Radio Big Band, Odense Symphony Orchestra, Adam Rudolph’s and Kresten Osgood’s orchestras and different choirs, among many other projects . She has recently released an album ‘Synesthesia’ with trio Sphere (Hevhetia label) and composed music for a play in The Danish Royal Theatre.
“Tribute to Jazz Divas” is a project dedicated to most phenomenal female voices in jazz history, like Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday or Sarah Vaughan. The repertoire consists of songs witten by the greatest american songwriters at that time: Rodgers&Heart, Cole Porter, Gershwin, Ellington, Strayhdorn among others.
Jazz Forum Magazine (PL) about Ania’s performance on Voicingers: “..the most impressive song performed by Ania was Wait Till You See Him with a special solo and lyrics written by her. She has a style, great taste, beautiful voice, and a natural stage charm.”<br><br>
