“This exceptionally courageous duo-project presents incredible imagination and skills of the artists in music, which really moves the listener. Voice ’n’ Drums is full of fantastic ideas and musical solutions." 

<i> ROBERT RATAJCZAK, Polish music critic and radio host </i>

“Voice ’n’ Drums is a remarkable international project in all respects - Ania Rybacka and Stefan Pasborg reconcile the atonal musical characteristics of the rhythm with the melody instrument - voice, in a new, excellent way.” 

<i> ANDREAS SCHIFFMANN, German journalist and music critic </i>

“Album Voice 'n' Drums is an impressive artwork, that thanks to great talent and creativity of the musicians, has shifted voice and drumming to a more sophisticated artistic context than one could ever imagine.”

<i> PETER DOBSINSKY, Slovak music critic, <a href="http://www.skjazz.sk">www.skjazz.sk</a></i>

“Voice’n’Drums is a  courageous attempt to create meaningful aural experiences within the minimalistic setting of voice and drums only, which surprisingly works out very successfully. Obviously cross-genre and unconventional, the music encompasses many different ingredients, both melodically and rhythmically (…) There are clearly elements of Jazz and Improvised music, but also World Music, Ambient, Meditative Music and others are involved. 

Ania Rybacka uses a plethora of wordless vocal techniques like looping, multiplexing, repetition and minimalistic Classical Music approach, creating a musical tapestry full of mysticism, anticipation and spirituality. Her level of inventiveness and exploration is awe inspiring and the album has no dull moments throughout its entire duration. Stefan Pasborg is not only equally inventive and diverse in his contributions, but most importantly an equal partner in the process of creating this music. The interplay and telepathic dialogue that develops between the two Artists is nothing short of phenomenal. 

Overall this avant-garde effort is a fascinating and intelligent exercise in expanding the boundaries of music, which in spite of its innovation and daring approach is also very listenable and enjoyable. This is an important and highly recommended album, which proves that imagination has no limits and life does not have to be mundane and enslaved in the chains of archaic perceptions.”
