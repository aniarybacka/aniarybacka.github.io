The Art Of Escapism
</center>

<br><br>

<p align="justify">
Using voice as the most expressive and intimate from all instruments, we have discovered a unique universe welcoming audience to escape from daily routine, matters of past and future. Abstract improvised stories made of unconventional vocal soundscapes and surprising effects, take listeners imagination for a creative spin. Strong and soft voices multiply ond cross each other, bringing emotions through cathartic climax to sense of balance and harmony. From the very first day of our cooperation it was clear for me and Lo, that our connection and instatnt understanding between us is very special will be hard to find elsewhere. This project is my source of deep spiritual moments, where I'm not sure anymore if the voice i hear comes from me, from Lo, or form something else.
