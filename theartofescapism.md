<p align="justify">The Art Of Escapism 
Ania Rybacka & Lo Ersare

Using voice as the most expressive and intimate from all instruments, we have discovered a unique universe welcoming audience to escape from daily routine, matters of past and future. Abstract improvised stories made of unconventional vocal soundscapes and surprising effects, take listeners imagination for a creative spin. Strong and soft voices multiply ond cross each other, bringing emotions through cathartic climax to sense of balance and harmony. In vocal world Lo and me have an understanding that is truly hard to find.
